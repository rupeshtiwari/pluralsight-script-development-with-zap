# Script Development with ZAP — Demo Labs

Hands-on labs for extending [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) beyond default
scans: targeted vulnerability validation, custom scripting, and DevSecOps
automation. Every lab runs against one deliberately vulnerable **Globomantics**
training application (Python/FastAPI + PostgreSQL + MongoDB) on your own machine.

> **Authorization and scope.** All techniques in these labs target **only** the
> local Globomantics training app. Never point them at any system you are not
> explicitly authorized to test.

## Set up your machine (once)

```bash
./env-setup/setup-macos.sh
```

This one script checks and, where needed, installs every dependency (Homebrew,
Colima, Docker, Docker Compose, tmux, Python) and pulls the pinned ZAP image. It
prints a readiness table and writes a full transcript to `env-setup/logs/`.

| 3 | Write Python scan and authentication scripts in ZAP | Custom Python scan rule and scripted login | EO2b · EO2c | Planned |

### Module 2 — Automated ZAP security gates in DevSecOps pipelines

| # | Lab | You will learn | Objectives | Links |
|---|-----|----------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Run authenticated ZAP scripts in GitHub Actions | Headless ZAP running your scripts in a pipeline | EO3a | Planned |

## Learning objectives

1. **Scanning techniques for specific vulnerabilities**
   - EO1a — Configure specialized scanners for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, command)
   - EO1b — Implement Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) validation with context-specific payloads
   - EO1c — Execute CSRF token-bypass techniques for testing anti-CSRF protections
2. **Utilize ZAP scripting for custom security tests**
   - EO2a — Develop JavaScript scripts to extend ZAP functionality
   - EO2b — Implement Python scripts for custom scanning rules
   - EO2c — Apply scripting for authentication sequence automation
3. **Integrate ZAP with DevSecOps pipelines**
   - EO3a — Configure ZAP for headless execution in CI/CD environments
   - EO3b — Implement ZAP API for programmatic security testing
   - EO3c — Apply threshold-based quality gates for security findings in build pipelines

## Technology used

ZAP 2.17.0 (`ghcr.io/zaproxy/zaproxy:stable`, pinned by digest), the
`ascanrules` and `ascanrulesBeta` active-scan add-ons, FastAPI, PostgreSQL,
MongoDB, Docker Compose, and Colima. Each lab uses the subset its objectives
require; the coverage of the full course tech stack is tracked as more labs land.
